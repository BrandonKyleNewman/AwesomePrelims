==============

Preliminary work for the Awesome library (not DisMaL).   Make subdirs jhenkens rmacklin pconrad for pieces.

THE CURRENT BEST VERSION OF set.js is in the rmacklin/js

For our next trick, we'll create a "master" directory in the top level, and start phasing out the individual ones.

From that point forward, we should only work in the master.
